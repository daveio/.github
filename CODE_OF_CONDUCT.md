# Code of Conduct

I'll keep it simple.

I won't put up with any bigotry or denigration of any marginalised people for any reason. I don't care if you've contributed, if you do it and I find out your credit for contributing will be removed.

I'll keep your changes, though. Cost of doing business.

The truth of the matter is that I'm fairly easygoing. Jokes are allowed; just punch **up**. If you're not a terrible person, we won't have a problem.
