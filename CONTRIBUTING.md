# Contributing

Contributions are always welcome to my public repositories.

Follow the standard pattern -

* Fork the repository
* Create a branch for your changes
* Make your changes, commit them, and push them
* Open a pull request

Please, **please**, make sure you've created a branch in your fork. Managing PRs where the changes are in `main` or `master` is a pain in the arse and it may cause me to reject your PR until it's in a branch.
