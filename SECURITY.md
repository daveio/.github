# Security

My repositories are personal projects; there is no money to pay any bug bounties.

If you'd like to report a security issue anyway, I'm very grateful.

Please submit it as a ticket in **Issues**. Feel free to encrypt it if you want privacy, my public key [is available on Keybase](https://keybase.io/dave) or [on my personal site](https://dave.io/public-key).

You can use the Keybase native crypto (good if you don't have a key yourself, as you can encrypt to me using the website without one) or GnuPG. Please include a link to (or export of) your public key if you use GnuPG.
