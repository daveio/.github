# Security

My repositories are personal projects; there is no money to pay any bug bounties.

If you'd like to report a security issue anyway, I'm very grateful.

Please submit it as a ticket in **Issues**. Feel free to encrypt it if you want privacy, my public key [is available on Keyoxide](https://keyoxide.org/729A7FAAB95A78A7AAB70E06B22EFAE146E2BB7E). Please include a link to (or export of) your public key.
