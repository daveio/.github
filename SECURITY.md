# Security

My repositories are personal projects; there is no money to pay any bug bounties.

If you'd like to report a security issue anyway, I'm very grateful.

Please submit it as a ticket in **Issues**. Feel free to encrypt it if you want privacy, my public key [is available on my personal site](https://dave.io/public-key) or [on `keys.openpgp.org`](https://keys.openpgp.org/vks/v1/by-fingerprint/D8DC6603D9C3515382A1C63C385FD3CEF5E5C6EC).

You can use the Keybase native crypto (good if you don't have a key yourself, as you can encrypt to me using the website without one) or GnuPG. Please include a link to (or export of) your public key if you use GnuPG.
